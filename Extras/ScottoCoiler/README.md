Diode coiling jig for handwired builds. You will need [16g](https://amzn.to/3OyQrq8) and [18g](https://amzn.to/3KNlCwH) wire in order to build it, along with some glue. Alternatively, you can purchase a pre-built one [here](https://scottokeebs.com/products/diode-coiling-jig).

Best printed in resin with something tough such as [Siraya Tech Blu](https://amzn.to/3q3jf1U).
